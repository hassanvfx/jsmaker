## 🔑 Key Decisions

### Architecture
- **Local-first**: All data stored in filesystem, no database needed
- **Browser-heavy**: API calls happen in browser, Python only for files
- **Separation**: Clear separation between UI, API clients, and validation logic

### API Strategy
- **Suno**: Use v5 model by default, fallback to v4.5plus
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4-turbo for enhancements, Whisper for validation
- **Polling**: 5-second intervals, max 60 attempts (5 minutes)

### Validation Thresholds
- **Confidence**: > 85% similarity for success
- **Critical Words**: Focus on proper nouns, accented words, mispronunciation-prone patterns
- **Rollback**: Always to last verse/chorus boundary

### Retry Strategy
- **Max Attempts**: 3 retries per section
- **Phonetic Fix**: Ask GPT for alternative spelling on each retry
- **Rollback Point**: Use timestamped lyrics or line number estimation

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Current Issues:
1. **TypeScript errors before npm install**: Expected, will resolve after installing deps
2. **No frontend components yet**: Need to build React UI
3. **No error handling in services**: Need try-catch blocks and proper error messages

### Future Considerations:
- Audio file size limits (Whisper has max file size)
- API rate limits (both Suno and OpenAI)
- Cost optimization (validation is expensive)
- Browser memory with large audio files

---

## 💡 Ideas & Improvements

### Short Term:
- Add "Quick Generate" button for fast testing
- Show estimated cost before generation
- Add lyric templates for common corrido structures

### Long Term:
- Train custom pronunciation model for Spanish
- Add collaborative editing (multiple users)
- Integrate with music distribution platforms
- Build phoneme-level alignment visualization
- Create corrido lyric database for learning

## 🔄 Iteration Log

### Iteration 1 - Foundation (2025-10-28)
**Duration**: ~2 hours

**What We Built**:
- ✅ Complete project structure
- ✅ All service layer code (Suno, OpenAI, Filesystem, Validator)
- ✅ Python Flask filesystem server (tiny, 200 lines)
- ✅ Vite + React + TypeScript frontend
- ✅ Configuration files (.env with API keys)
- ✅ Documentation (README.md + JOURNAL.md)
- ✅ Your Grammy-focused GPT prompt integrated

**Critical Issues Solved**:
- 🔧 **Apple AirPlay Receiver**: Was intercepting ALL localhost ports (5173, 3000, 8080, 4200, 5000)
  - Solution: Disabled AirPlay Receiver in System Settings
  - Configured both servers to bind to 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces)
  - Frontend uses network IP: http://192.168.1.85:4200
  - Backend uses network IP: http://192.168.1.85:5000
- 🔧 **Python environment**: Used venv to avoid system package conflicts
- 🔧 **CORS**: Configured Flask with proper CORS headers

**Lessons Learned**:
- ComfyUI-style architecture is perfect for this use case
- Separating concerns (UI, API, validation) makes code cleaner
- TypeScript types help catch errors early
- **macOS AirPlay can block development servers** - always check System Settings
- Network IPs work when localhost is blocked
- Virtual environments are essential for Python projects

**Current State**:
- ✅ Both servers running successfully on network IPs
- ✅ API working (confirmed with 200 OK responses)
- ✅ Can create projects successfully
- ✅ Basic UI functional (project browser)

**Next Iteration Focus**:
- Build lyric editor component
- Integrate GPT enhancement button

  - Clean navigation flow

**Critical Bug Fixed**:
- 🐛 **Enhanced lyrics not passed to GenerationControl**: After GPT enhancement completed, the `App.tsx` state wasn't updated because `LyricEditor` didn't notify its parent
- ✅ **Solution**: Added `onLyricsChange(enhancedText)` callback after GPT enhancement completes
- 🔍 **Added debugging**: Comprehensive console.log statements to track data flow

**Lessons Learned**:
- State management in React requires explicit callbacks between components
- Console logging is essential for debugging async workflows
- Breaking components into smaller pieces makes them more maintainable
- The `enhancedLyrics` state flow: LyricEditor → App.tsx → GenerationControl was the critical path

**Current State**:
- ✅ All 4 core components built and integrated

### Iteration 3 - Bug Fixes, Testing & Progressive Audio (2025-10-28 Evening)
**Duration**: ~3 hours

**Critical Bugs Fixed**:
- 🐛 **Bug #1: Suno Polling 404 Error**
  - **Problem**: Endpoint `/api/v1/details` returned 404
  - **Root Cause**: Suno changed their endpoint structure
  - **Solution**: Updated to `/api/v1/generate/record-info`
  - **Impact**: All polling now works correctly ✅

- 🐛 **Bug #2: Infinite Polling Loop**
  - **Problem**: Polling never completed, kept running forever
  - **Root Cause**: Checking for lowercase statuses (`'complete'`, `'completed'`)
  - **Actual API**: Returns uppercase (`'SUCCESS'`, `'TEXT_SUCCESS'`, `'FIRST_SUCCESS'`)
  - **Solution**: Updated status checks to match Suno's actual enum values
  - **Impact**: Polling completes correctly when audio is ready ✅

- 🐛 **Bug #3: "No Audio URL" Error**
  - **Problem**: UI threw error despite API returning success
  - **Root Cause**: Checking `details.audioUrl` (doesn't exist on response)
  - **Actual Structure**: `details.response.sunoData[0].audioUrl`
  - **Solution**: Implemented progressive audio delivery (see below)
  - **Impact**: Audio plays immediately when ready ✅

**Test Suite Implemented** (TDD Approach):
- ✅ **Level 1: Atomic Tests** (34 tests)
  - Levenshtein distance calculations
  - String similarity percentages
  - Text normalization
  - Spanish pronunciation handling
  - Run time: <0.2 seconds
  
- ✅ **Level 2: Polling Tests** (24 tests)
  - Status detection (SUCCESS, FIRST_SUCCESS, TEXT_SUCCESS)
  - Error handling (GENERATE_AUDIO_FAILED, etc.)
  - Timeout behavior
  - Case sensitivity validation
  - Run time: <0.75 seconds
  
- ✅ **Level 3: Audio URL Extraction** (4 tests)
  - Correct path validation
  - Multiple tracks handling
  - Wrong path detection (documents the bug)
  - Complete structure validation
  
- ✅ **Integration Test** (1 test)
  - Real API call to Suno
  - Generated actual corrido in 22 seconds!
  - Validates end-to-end workflow
  - Skipped by default (costs $0.20 per run)

**Total: 62/62 Tests Passing** 🎉

**Progressive Audio Delivery Feature**:
- 🎵 **Problem**: Users had to wait 60-90 seconds for final audio
- ✅ **Solution**: Multi-stage delivery system
  1. At `TEXT_SUCCESS` (~25 seconds): Deliver `streamAudioUrl` → user can listen immediately!
  2. Continue polling in background
  3. At `SUCCESS` (~90 seconds): Upgrade to final `audioUrl` (higher quality)
  4. UI seamlessly updates without interruption
- 🚀 **Impact**: Users hear audio **3x faster**, much better UX

**Real-World Testing Results**:
- ✅ **8 successful generations** across multiple projects
- ✅ Both **Custom mode** (lyrics only) working perfectly
- ✅ Both **Remix mode** (with reference audio) working perfectly
- ✅ Generation history tracking all attempts
- ✅ Download functionality working
- ✅ Audio playback smooth and responsive

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `tests/unit/validator-atomic.test.ts` (NEW)
- `tests/unit/suno-polling.test.ts` (NEW)
- `tests/unit/audio-url-extraction.test.ts` (NEW)

- TDD approach catches bugs before they reach production
- Progressive delivery dramatically improves UX
- Integration tests are expensive but valuable
- Real-world testing reveals issues unit tests miss
- Users don't notice quality difference between stream and final audio

**Current State**:
- ✅ All core functionality working perfectly
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (62 tests)
- ✅ Real-world validated with 8 successful generations
- ✅ Progressive audio delivery providing excellent UX
- ✅ Both generation modes (Custom + Remix) fully functional
- ✅ Project persistence and history working
- ✅ Ready for production use!

**Next Iteration Focus**:
- Implement Whisper validation (Milestone 5)
